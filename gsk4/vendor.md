<!-- struct BroadwayRenderer -->


# Implements

[`RendererExt`](trait.RendererExt.html)
<!-- impl BroadwayRenderer::fn new -->
Creates a new Broadway renderer.

The Broadway renderer is the default renderer for the broadway backend.
It will only work with broadway surfaces, otherwise it will fail the
call to `gdk_renderer_realize`.

This function is only available when GTK was compiled with Broadway
support.

# Returns

a new Broadway renderer.
<!-- struct CairoRenderer -->


# Implements

[`RendererExt`](trait.RendererExt.html)
<!-- impl CairoRenderer::fn new -->
Creates a new Cairo renderer.

The Cairo renderer is the fallback renderer drawing in ways similar
to how GTK 3 drew its content. Its primary use is as comparison tool.

The Cairo renderer is incomplete. It cannot render 3D transformed
content and will instead render an error marker. Its usage should be
avoided.

# Returns

a new Cairo renderer.
<!-- enum Corner -->
The corner indices used by `RoundedRect`.
<!-- enum Corner::variant TopLeft -->
The top left corner
<!-- enum Corner::variant TopRight -->
The top right corner
<!-- enum Corner::variant BottomRight -->
The bottom right corner
<!-- enum Corner::variant BottomLeft -->
The bottom left corner
<!-- struct GLRenderer -->


# Implements

[`RendererExt`](trait.RendererExt.html)
<!-- impl GLRenderer::fn new -->
Creates a new `Renderer` using OpenGL. This is the default renderer
used by GTK.

# Returns

a new GL renderer
<!-- struct RenderNode -->
The `GskRenderNode` structure contains only private data.
<!-- impl RenderNode::fn draw -->
Draw the contents of `self` to the given cairo context.

Typically, you'll use this function to implement fallback rendering
of `GskRenderNodes` on an intermediate Cairo context, instead of using
the drawing context associated to a `gdk::Surface`'s rendering buffer.

For advanced nodes that cannot be supported using Cairo, in particular
for nodes doing 3D operations, this function may fail.
## `cr`
cairo context to draw to
<!-- impl RenderNode::fn get_bounds -->
Retrieves the boundaries of the `self`. The node will not draw outside
of its boundaries.
## `bounds`
return location for the boundaries
<!-- impl RenderNode::fn get_node_type -->
Returns the type of the `self`.

# Returns

the type of the `RenderNode`
<!-- impl RenderNode::fn ref -->
Acquires a reference on the given `RenderNode`.

# Returns

the `RenderNode` with an additional reference
<!-- impl RenderNode::fn serialize -->
Serializes the `self` for later deserialization via
`RenderNode::deserialize`. No guarantees are made about the format
used other than that the same version of GTK+ will be able to deserialize
the result of a call to `RenderNode::serialize` and
`RenderNode::deserialize` will correctly reject files it cannot open
that were created with previous versions of GTK+.

The intended use of this functions is testing, benchmarking and debugging.
The format is not meant as a permanent storage format.

# Returns

a `glib::Bytes` representing the node.
<!-- impl RenderNode::fn unref -->
Releases a reference on the given `RenderNode`.

If the reference was the last, the resources associated to the `self` are
freed.
<!-- impl RenderNode::fn write_to_file -->
This function is equivalent to calling `RenderNode::serialize`
followed by `g_file_set_contents`. See those two functions for details
on the arguments.

It is mostly intended for use inside a debugger to quickly dump a render
node to a file for later inspection.
## `filename`
the file to save it to.

# Returns

`true` if saving was successful
<!-- impl RenderNode::fn deserialize -->
Loads data previously created via `RenderNode::serialize`. For a
discussion of the supported format, see that function.
## `bytes`
the bytes containing the data

# Returns

a new `RenderNode` or `None` on
 error.

## `surface`
a `gdk::Surface`

# Returns

a `Renderer`
<!-- trait RendererExt::fn get_surface -->
Retrieves the `gdk::Surface` set using `RendererExt::realize`. If the renderer
has not been realized yet, `None` will be returned.

# Returns

a `gdk::Surface`
<!-- trait RendererExt::fn is_realized -->
Checks whether the `self` is realized or not.

# Returns

`true` if the `Renderer` was realized, and `false` otherwise
<!-- trait RendererExt::fn realize -->
Creates the resources needed by the `self` to render the scene
graph.
## `surface`
the `gdk::Surface` renderer will be used on
<!-- trait RendererExt::fn render -->
Renders the scene graph, described by a tree of `RenderNode` instances,
ensuring that the given `region` gets redrawn.

Renderers must ensure that changes of the contents given by the `root`
node as well as the area given by `region` are redrawn. They are however
free to not redraw any pixel outside of `region` if they can guarantee that
it didn't change.

The `self` will acquire a reference on the `RenderNode` tree while
the rendering is in progress.
## `root`
a `RenderNode`
## `region`
the `cairo::Region` that must be redrawn or `None`
 for the whole window
<!-- trait RendererExt::fn render_texture -->
Renders the scene graph, described by a tree of `RenderNode` instances,
to a `gdk::Texture`.

The `self` will acquire a reference on the `RenderNode` tree while
the rendering is in progress.

If you want to apply any transformations to `root`, you should put it into a
transform node and pass that node instead.
## `root`
a `RenderNode`
## `viewport`
the section to draw or `None` to use `root`'s bounds

# Returns

a `gdk::Texture` with the rendered contents of `root`.
<!-- trait RendererExt::fn unrealize -->

Errors that can happen during (de)serialization.
<!-- enum SerializationError::variant UnsupportedFormat -->
The format can not be
 identified
<!-- enum SerializationError::variant UnsupportedVersion -->
The version of the data
 is not understood
<!-- enum SerializationError::variant InvalidData -->
The given data may not exist in
 a proper serialization
<!-- struct Transform -->
The `GskTransform` structure contains only private data.
<!-- impl Transform::fn equal -->
Checks two matrices for equality. Note that matrices need to be literally
identical in their operations, it is not enough that they return the
same result in `Transform::to_matrix`.
## `second`
the second matrix

# Returns

`true` if the two matrices can be proven to be equal
<!-- impl Transform::fn get_category -->
Returns the category this transform belongs to.

# Returns

The category of the transform
<!-- impl Transform::fn invert -->
Inverts the given transform.

If `self` is not invertible, `None` is returned.
Note that inverting `None` also returns `None`, which is
the correct inverse of `None`. If you need to differentiate
between those cases, you should check `self` is not `None`
before calling this function.

# Returns

The inverted transform or `None` if the transform
 cannot be inverted.
<!-- impl Transform::fn matrix -->
Multiplies `self` with the given `matrix`.
## `matrix`
the matrix to multiply `self` with

# Returns

The new matrix
<!-- impl Transform::fn perspective -->
Applies a perspective projection transform. This transform
scales points in X and Y based on their Z value, scaling
points with positive Z values away from the origin, and
those with negative Z values towards the origin. Points
on the z=0 plane are unchanged.
## `depth`
distance of the z=0 plane. Lower values give a more
 flattened pyramid and therefore a more pronounced
 perspective effect.

# Returns

The new matrix

Converts `self` into a human-readable string representation suitable
for printing that can later be parsed with `Transform::parse`.
## `string`
The string to print into

return location for the scale
 factor in the y direction

the string to parse
## `out_transform`
The location to put the transform in

# Returns

`true` if `string` described a valid transform.
<!-- enum TransformCategory -->
The categories of matrices relevant for GSK and GTK. Note that any
category includes matrices of all later categories. So if you want
to for example check if a matrix is a 2D matrix,
`category >= GSK_TRANSFORM_CATEGORY_2D` is the way to do this.

Also keep in mind that rounding errors may cause matrices to not
conform to their categories. Otherwise, matrix operations done via
mutliplication will not worsen categories. So for the matrix
multiplication `C = A * B`, `category(C) = MIN (category(A), category(B))`.
<!-- enum TransformCategory::variant Unknown -->
The category of the matrix has not been
 determined.
<!-- enum TransformCategory::variant Any -->
Analyzing the matrix concluded that it does
 not fit in any other category.
<!-- enum TransformCategory::variant 3d -->
The matrix is a 3D matrix. This means that
 the w column (the last column) has the values (0, 0, 0, 1).
<!-- enum TransformCategory::variant 2d -->
The matrix is a 2D matrix. This is equivalent
 to `graphene::Matrix::is_2d` returning `true`. In particular, this
 means that Cairo can deal with the matrix.
<!-- enum TransformCategory::variant 2dAffine -->
The matrix is a combination of 2D scale
 and 2D translation operations. In particular, this means that any
 rectangle can be transformed exactly using this matrix.
<!-- enum TransformCategory::variant 2dTranslate -->
The matrix is a 2D translation.
<!-- enum TransformCategory::variant Identity -->
The matrix is the identity matrix.
<!-- struct VulkanRenderer -->
